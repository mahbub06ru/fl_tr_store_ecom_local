A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Features:
1. Displaying product list from api and local storage
2. Displaying product details from api and local storage
3. Add to cart and displaying cart item with calculation using api and local storage

Considering low-end mobile device users in rural areas, I have maintained local storage of all those features
for smooth operation where products will be saved initially in api call with network checking first.

I use sqflite for local databse, GETX for state management, shimmar effect for loading, and observable variables.
I also used badge for displaying item count in cart. I have committed block of codes coming from api for understanding 
or use to later if necessary.

Thanks
